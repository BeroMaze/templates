There are many different pages; About page, drink Voting page, Countdown page, Game Page, and a thank you page. Head over to the Whalephants website and vote on the next drinks that they will be making out at Burning Man or go over and play the Hang Man game. There are three words, see if you can guess all of them. </br>'

For this project we had to focus in using Jquery and object junctions. This project had a lot of adding and taking away from the page. I also used a chart to show the results. for storing the voting information, I set up a local storage JSON function so that you could simulate multiply people voting on the images.'
